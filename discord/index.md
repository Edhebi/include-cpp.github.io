## Background

Much of the work of running `#include <C++>` happens online on our Discord server, in channels dedicated to that purpose. In addition, the server has dozens of channels for discussing various topics that are relevant to C++ developers and other members of our community.

All our channels are moderated, to ensure that we remain a welcoming community. See [Moderation](/moderation/).

## Getting Started with Discord

To use Discord, you can use a web page, or clients for PC, Mac, and Linux desktops as well as for phones. When you follow our Discord link to join, you'll be given information about clients you can install.

When you join, by following this **[Invitation to Join Discord](https://discord.gg/ZPErMGW)**, you will receive a copy of our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct/) and a bot will welcome you in our #welcome channel. Often people who are online will say hello, and you can introduce yourself there.

## Channels

We try to have separate channels for distinct topics, for example the #compilers channel has entirely different topics than the #testing channel.

Things to note in the above screenshot:

* The coloured #include logo represents our Discord Server. 
* Channels are shown in a sidebar (which you may have to open with a [hamburger menu button](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button), if on a small screen).
* Channels with a bold name have messages you haven't yet seen.
* Channels with a non-bold name do not have any new messages.

## Managing Message Volume

### Muting channels

* If a channel doesn't interest you, you can mute it, then the channel name will be faint, such as the #assembly channel in the screenshot above.
* You can still read muted channels at any time.
* You can also hide muted channels, in the server settings - see "Hide Muted Channels" near the bottom in this image:
    *  ![Server Settings](/images/server_settings.png)
  
### Channel Groups

* Channels are grouped by category, to keep like-with-like.
* You can collapse categories, which hides all contained channels with no new messages, as shown below:

## Other Information

Note: we only have text channels, and we do not allow custom emojis.
