* [Language](/resources/language/) - and why language matters
    * Developers **don't just write code**. We write documentation, emails, and much more. We type in chat windows with our colleagues and friends and we speak aloud, in casual and more formal settings, about our work and our code. The language we use in those contexts matters.   
    Sometimes we **accidentally exclude other people** with the words we choose, or make them feel lesser or hurt. In this section we talk about language, how it matters, and **how to use it** in an **inclusive and welcoming** way.
