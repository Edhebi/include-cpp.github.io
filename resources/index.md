* [Language](/resources/language/) - and why language matters
    * Developers **don't just write code**. We write documentation, emails, and much more. We type in chat windows with our colleagues and friends and we speak aloud, in casual and more formal settings, about our work and our code. The language we use in those contexts matters.   
    Sometimes we **accidentally exclude other people** with the words we choose, or make them feel lesser or hurt. In this section we talk about language, how it matters, and **how to use it** in an **inclusive and welcoming** way.
<!-- * [Discriminations](/resources/discriminations/) -->
* [Domains](/resources/domains/)
    * Many people may be working to change the way they behave in order to be more welcoming and inclusive. We have gathered some inclusion-specific resources for areas including conferences, and jobs and hiring.
* [References](/resources/references/)
  * In this section we link to reference material on the C++ language itself, chosen by members of our Discord server. We also have links to other organisations that promote inclusion and diversity. 
* [Articles](/resources/articles/)
