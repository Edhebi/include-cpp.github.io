## New Structure

In October 2020 we rearranged the Resources section on this site, to prepare for adding much more content.

Here's where to find things now....

* Old '**Conference Resources**' page
    * This page has moved to the [Conferences](/resources/domains/conferences/) page
* Old '**Equality and Diversity**' page
    * This page has been split up in to the [Language](/resources/language/) and [Articles](/resources/articles/) pages
    * In particular, the Guys section has moved to the [Guys](/resources/language/#guys) section
* Old '**Other Organisations**' page
    * This page has moved to the [Organisations](/resources/references/#organisations) section 
* Old '**Recruitment**' Page
    * This page has moved to the [Jobs](/resources/domains/jobs/) page

## Redirects

References to the old pages all redirect to this new page. Site maintainers can [check the redirects](/internal/check_redirects/).
