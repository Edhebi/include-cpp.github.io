## Unconscious and implicit bias

* [Managing unconscious bias -- Facebook](https://managingbias.fb.com/)
  * A series of videos on recognising unconscious biases which you have and suggestions on how to counter them.
  * Split into multiple sections:
    * Series introduction
    * First impressions -- if you aren't sure about watching the series, watch this one; it will get you thinking about your own biases which you may not have thought about before.
    * Stereotypes and performance bias
    * Performance attribution bias
    * Competence/Likeability tradeoff bias
    * Maternal bias
    * Business case for diversity and inclusion
   * The content is very well presented and the videos can be watched independently of one another.
* [eLesson: Unconscious Bias -- Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/diversity/training/default.aspx)
  * More of a corporate approach, which may be boring for some engineers, but there's some good content.
  * This is mostly focused on meetings rather than the many other forms of collaboration which we use.
  * If you are a manager then this is probably a better option than the Facebook one.

* [One Simple Skill to Curb Unconscious Gender Bias:  Crucial Skills](http://www.crucialskills.com/2015/08/one-simple-skill-to-curb-unconscious-gender-bias/)
