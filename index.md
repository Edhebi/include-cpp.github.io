## Who are we?

`#include<C++>` is a global, inclusive, and diverse community for developers interested in C++. Here, you can find a welcoming space to learn and discuss C++. We also provide resources to create safer, more inclusive, community gatherings.

We believe that a community is only as good as how it treats its most vulnerable members. Therefore, we strive to create a welcoming, safe, and accessible environment. We have a strong [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct), which we [enforce](/moderation).

Our primary communication platform is our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ZPErMGW). Join us to discuss and learn C++ in a welcoming, inclusive space.

The moderation and administration team are [Patricia Aas](https://twitter.com/pati_gallardo), [Sy Brand](https://twitter.com/TartanLlama), [Noam Chitayat](https://twitter.com/_Noam), [Guy Davidson](https://twitter.com/hatcat01), [Timur Doumler](https://twitter.com/timur_audio), [Kate Gregory](https://twitter.com/gregcons), [Adi Shavit](https://twitter.com/AdiShavit), [Fred Tingaud](https://twitter.com/FredTingaudDev), [Bryce Lelbach](https://twitter.com/blelbach) and others.

## What do we do?

We are still in the process of getting set up, but we plan to provide the following:

- A set of [resources](/resources) on diversity and inclusion.
- An inclusive, welcoming space for people to discuss and learn C++.
  - We have a Discord server which you can join through [this link](https://discord.gg/ZPErMGW).
  - We have a [friendly presence at conferences](/attending-conferences).
- A [toolbox](https://github.com/include-cpp/toolboxes) for C++ conferences to improve diversity and inclusion.
- Help for conferences in reaching minority groups with calls for papers, and suggesting candidates to invite to speak and <a class="page-link" href="/organising-conferences/">running an inclusive conference</a>.
- Help for companies in improving their C++ job advertisements to improve appeal to minority groups.
- Help for minorities and junior programmers to [attend major conferences](/scholarships).
- Help for minorities and junior programmers in submitting talks for conferences or job applications.

## Why make another organisation?

There are many organisations focused on improving diversity and inclusion in the tech space. However, we are in a very good place to target the C++ community specifically, because many of those involved are C++ experts with connections to conferences and companies where a difference can be made.

## I like your T-Shirts, can I buy one?

Yes. See our <a class="page-link" href="/shop/">Shop</a> page. We have more than just shirts!
